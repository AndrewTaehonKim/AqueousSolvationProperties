___________ Completed _______________
Code for Reading SMILES (Lareine & Andrew)
Code for Energy Optimization (Andrew)
Code for Solvation Energy (Andrew)

____________ To Be Done ____________

Code for Solvation Optimization (Andrew)
Code for Geometry Optimization (Andrew & Lareine)
    - Needs to be faster and more robust with random SMILES
    - Adjust learning rate to be flexible for faster convergence with fewer SCF cycles per iteration

Code for Energy STD (Andrew &)
Code for Solvation Energy STD (Andrew &)
    - Robust Perturbation Method (Andrew &) that is not so sensitive to perturbation magnitude

Code for Tests with known and unknown test cases (Andrew & Lareine & Ubaidullah)
Test cases [H20 (simple), SO2 (polar sulfur), Ethane (Stevenson example), chloro-Benzene (resonance chlorine), H2PO4 (acid), 1,3,5-trifluoro-Benzene] vs. better DFT [ORCA] (Ubaidullah) # please feel free to change test cases based on what you think captures what could happen to molecules in water
